  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Portland, OR, and have always lived in this city.  My favorite part about living in Portland is the convenient access to beaches, mountains, forests, lakes, desert, etc.  Not to mention, there is some great food in Portland as well!  I'm a big music fan, and I also play in my own band called <a href="http://dogheartband.com">Dogheart</a>.
